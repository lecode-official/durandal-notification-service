# Durandal Notification Service

A simple notification library written in TypeScript, which can be used to display notifications to the user. This notification service is made to be used in conjunction with the Durandal SPA application framework. Since the Durandal framework is no longer being actively developed and has been superseded by Aurelia, this project is also no longer active.
